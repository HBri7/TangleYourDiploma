# Tangle Your Diploma
A proof of concept based on IOTA technology

## Hosted?
Yes: https://diploma.makeittangle.com/

## Why?
While being at Ecole 42 in Paris we wanted to demonstrate how easy it is to get going with IOTA. We know the application is far from bug free and does not comply with a lot of coding standards :-)

## What does it do?
This application makes it possible to store official documents like diplomas in an immutable way. Schools and companies that issue the documents can also add their signature to it so it can be verified later on that they actually issued the document.

## Run it
To get going just clone the repo, run `npm install` followed by `npm start` and there you go! Open a browser on `localhost:3000` and you can start using the application! Don't forget to change the keys!
